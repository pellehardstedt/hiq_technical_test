### What is this repository for? ###
This repository serves as a technical interview for developers pursuing a position at HiQ Sk√•ne.

## Instructions ##
Thank you for taking the time to do HiQ's recruitment test. It consists of two parts:
* Coding test
* A few questions

### Coding test ###
* Your task is to build a web application that processes files containing text.
* The user should upload a file from his or her browser to the server and then be presented with the processed text.
* In the processed text, the application should surround every occurrence of the most used word with foo and bar.
    * Example: If the most used word is 'hiq', the processed text should display 'foohiqbar' instead of 'hiq'.
* In this repository you'll find some useful text files for testing your application.
* Choose one of the options below for your web application:
    * Develop a web application (frontend only)
    * Develop a restful web API (backend only)
    * Develop a web application with a restful web API and frontend
* You are free to choose what specific technologies to use in this assignment, however we suggest
    * ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET Framework for backend
    * JavaScript, React/Vue/Angular for frontend
    * Webpack
    * Automated tests are nice, but not mandatory
    * Please list of all your technical choises and motivate them

### Questions ###
Please answer these questions in a markdown file called `Answers.md`.

1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?
2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
4. What did you think of this recruitment test?


## Where do I hand in my solution? ##
* Please send your solution to [anna.eggert@hiq.se](mailto:anna.eggert@hiq.se) as a zip-file 
    * All typically ignored files and folders should be removed (node_modules, bin etc).
    * The zip-file should contain a clone of this git repo, with your work added in commit(s).

### If we agree to meet for an interview ###
* Please bring your web application along to your interview
    * Be prepared to run and demonstrate the application. 
    * Be prepared to present the code in an IDE of your choice on your own computer. 
* In addition to this assignment you should also be prepared to show other projects you developed (if you have any).

### If I have any questions ###
If you have any questions about your assignment you are welcome to contact Anna Eggert at [anna.eggert@hiq.se](mailto:anna.eggert@hiq.se)
